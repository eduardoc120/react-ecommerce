            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                Our story began in 2011 in a small factory shop in the middle of Mexico City. With only one
                desk and next to no free time, our brand was born. Our passion for unique design and 
                collaboration brought our vision, and products, to life.
            </p>
            <p>
                We started making the products we wanted to see in the world and
                we did this with an uncompromising approach to sustainability and environmental affects.  We promote our
                products because we believe in them and we stand behind our product.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our products bring together the finest materials and stunning design to create something
                very special. We believe in quality, care, and creating unique products that everyone can
                enjoy. Colorful, creative, and inspired by what we see everyday, each product represents what
                we love about the world we live in. We hope theyâ€™ll inspire you too.
